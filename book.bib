  abstract = {Bayesian statistical methods have become widely used for data
              analysis and modelling in recent years, and the BUGS software has
              become the most popular software for Bayesian analysis worldwide.
              This book provides a practical introduction to this program and its
              use. The text presents complete coverage of all the functionalities
              of BUGS, including prediction, missing data, model criticism, and
              prior sensitivity. It also features a large number of worked
              examples and a wide range of applications from various
              disciplines.--[book cover]},
